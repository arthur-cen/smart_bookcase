### Problem Statement / Co-Design
Sarah is 30 years old female working as a Physician Assistant at the UPMC Shadyside, Pittsburgh. She lives by herself with two cats. Although she has a successful career and loves her life, she always misses her mom who lives in a different city. She becomes even more sentimental when she goes back to her dark home. She loves to read because she has a good memory with her mom reading books before she went to bed every night when she was young. She wishes that there’s a product that helps her delightful childhood memory when she read every night.

### Stake Holder
After we interviewed with Sarah, we defined our potential stakeholders as below;

- Primary stakeholders are young professionals who live in big cities away from their families
- Secondary stakeholders are parents or love ones of primary stakeholders, booksellers and furniture makers 
- Key stakeholders are funders, book authors, publishers, medias

### Design Approach
Our team wants to make sure that Sarah feels homey when she relaxes at her house after spending long hours at the hospital. She is physically and mentally exhausted and wanted to feel eased while she is reading her favorite books at home. Also, she wants to feel connected with her mom away back home. 

### Design Decision and Solution
Our team decided to make an ambient bookcase that is connected to other devices, the same bookcase. Once one side of the user picks a book to read from the bookcase, the other side of the device displays the same title and quote. Two devices are connected in distance and help two or many parties to feel more connected to each other by reading the same books because they have something in common to share together.

### System Design Concept
Two and more users are interconnected with each other with the particle cloud system.  We want our bookcase helping us connect with the people in our lives and build intimate relationships by sharing common knowledge of reading books.

### Component and Supplies
1. Particle Argon with headers
2. USB Micro B Cable
3. Wifi Antenna
4. 1 Mini Breadboards
5. 2x16 I2C 5V LCD Screen
6. Alligator clamps
7. 5V voltage regulator
8. 9V battery
9. Several Wires as needed and retray
10. Copper Fibers (for making manual switch)
11. Copper wires
12. LED lights
13. 2 x 4.75kΩ resistors and 3 x 1kΩ resistor

### Development Procedure
1. Co-design with a friend
2. Design the logic system of program
3. Check items that we need additionally especially the ones we do not have in our studio.
4. Write the coding according to the design we envisioned.
5. Connect with particle cloud.
6. Make a 1st proto bookcase with foam-core.
7. Install wires and sensors into the bookcase.
8. Connect a breadboard with wires.
9. Test out the entire system.  

### User Test
Sarah tested the sample and shared her experience with our team. She liked the sample overall and suggested one major improvement - changing sensors. Although she liked our first proto a lot, she did not like the way that she has to pay extra attention when she returns the books to the bookcase. She asked us if we can eliminate pedals and replace them with different sensors. In that sense, she does not have to worry about putting the books back to exact spots to land the books on the pedals.

We foresee her feedback and will iterate the sensors and the design accordingly.

We also found that the LED screen displayed symbols or alphabets instead of illuminating full sentences of quotations during the demonstration. After we disconnect the powers and plugin, it worked, but we will debug code error and fix the malfunctioning screen.
